- Accent color: Pink (#F020A0), contrasting in both brightness and saturation to the primary color, for emphasis on interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text; this pairing is intended to offer readability, a touch of warmth and approachability alongside a trendy and contemporary design.

- Employ a grid-based layout for product listings and vendor displays, ensuring a clean, organized, and responsive user experience. Use clear visual separation between sections using subtle dividers and whitespace.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations and loading spinners, enhancing user engagement and perceived performance.
